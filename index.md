` def myFunction(optionalParameters): `   # basic function definition
    ` do stuff in the function `

` screen = turtle.Screen() `            # creating a screen object
` screen.onkey(functionName, "key") `   # connecting the key with the function

` if num > 10: `                      # basic if-statement
` elif (insert another condition): `  # else-if-statement
` else: `                             # else statement

` t.xcor() `    # returns x-coordinate of the turtle
` t.ycor() `    # returns y-coordinate of the turtle

` while True: `                       # begin a while-loop
`   if a > b: `                       # random condition to check
`     break   `                       # jump out of a while-loop

` myList = [] `         # create an empty list
` myList.append(item) ` # add an item to the end of the list

` for i in range(10): `     # fast way of adding items to a list
  ` t = turtle.Turtle() `
  ` t.shape('circle') `
  ` t.speed(5) `

` for (variableName) in myList: `     # iterate through a list
  ` variableName.doSomething() `

### Project 1 - Space Eater
This is your second-to-last project. You will be creating a real video game! Here's how it works: 
- You are a rocket flying through space. The rocket continually moves forward by itself. You turn left or right with the arrow keys!
- There is a boundary you cannot leave. If you hit a wall, you are turned around 180 degrees and lose 1 of your 3 lives. 
- There are balls floating around in space that you want to collect! Each time you hit one with your ship, your score goes up by one point! 
- Try to get as many points as you can! 
- BONUS: Add another level so when you get 5 points, the speed of the game goes up and there are more balls to eat!



### MASTER PROJECT
- You will just have to wait and see what this is... ;)
