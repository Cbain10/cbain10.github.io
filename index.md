Important Points:
```markdown

` if num > 10: `                      # basic if-statement
` elif (insert another condition): `  # else-if-statement
` else: `                             # else statement

```

### Project 1 - If Shapes
```Generate a random number! If the random number is greater than 10, draw an octagon. If not, draw a hexagon!```

### Project 2 - Which Way?!
```Have the computer generate a random number. Using conditionals, have the turtle do different things based off the random number! If it is less than 11, have it go forward, if it is less than 21 and greater than 11, have it turn right 45 degrees, then go forward. Otherwise, have the turtle turn right 90 degrees and go ward! Have the turtle change colors for each case!```

### Project 3 - Rebounder!
```Draw a box for the ball to bouce off! Use a while True loop to get the ball to keep moving. Use conditionals to have the ball bounce back before leaving the box!```
