```

Important Code:
```markdown

`print("Hello world!") `        # print to the console
`myVar = input("Enter your input: ") `      # prompt user for input, save as variable
`print("This is my variable: ", myVar) `    # print words and variable
`int(myVar) `              # cast a variable to an integer (number)
`str(myVar) `              # cast a variable to a string (word, sentence, or a collection of characters)

Prompt the user to enter two numbers, then print the sum, difference, product, and dividend of those two numbers!

### Project 5 - More Calculations!
Prompt the user for one more number. Print to the console the number doubled, squared, the square root, and the remainder after dividing by two!

### Project 6 - Remainders pt. 2
Create a program that works as a division calculator. Prompt the user for a number to divide, a number to divide by, and then print the result to the console. Output should be something like this: "3 / 2 = 1R1" or "22 / 4 = 5R2"
