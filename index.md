### Variable Exercise
- We are going to build a small program that does some math
- First, let's ask the user to enter a starting number
- Then we will tell them that we are going to add 10 to that number a certain amount of times. 
- Prompt the user to enter how many times we should add 10 to the starting number
- Print the words "You added 10: number is now ..." (but with the actual value) for each iteration!
- USE AS MANY VARIABLES AS YOU CAN
