# Lesson 4 - Loops (While and For)

[Repl.it](https://repl.it/~)

Key Terms:
```markdown
variable - a piece of data/information for us to use in our code
integer - a number variable (ex: 8)
string - a word, sentence, or a collection of characters in a variable (ex: "i like turtles")
% - modulo - gives the remainder --> ex: 5 % 2 = 1
```

Important Code:
```markdown

`myVar = input("Enter your input: ") `      # prompt user for input, save as variable
`str(myVar) `              # cast a variable to a string (word, sentence, or a collection of characters)
`while (conditional expression): `  #declare a while loop
example: `while (myVar > 0): `
`for i in range(myVar): `   #basic for loop

```
  
### Project 1 - While loop game
- You are going to build a math game
- Start by asking the user if they are ready to begin
- If they are ready, start the game. If they decide not to play, that should be the end of your program)
- Have the user enter any number
- Tell them to perform some calculations on that number (example: multiply by 2, add 3, subtract 20, times 3...)
- Ask them to enter their final answer
- Tell the user whether or not their answer was correct.
- Ask them if they would like to play again
(Hint: This program will use a while-loop for the game portion, have the user enter "y" or "n" when asked if they want to play again, keep playing as long as their answer is 'y')
You got this!!!
