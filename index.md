# Lesson 7 - Event Listeners

[Repl.it](https://repl.it/~)

Important Points:
```markdown

` screen = turtle.Screen() `      # create a screen object
` screen.onkey(nameOfYourFunction, "key") `   # link the function to the keys
` screen.listen() `   # the screen starts "listening" for your keyboard input

```

### Project 1 - Free Draw
```Use Event Listeners to make the turtle turn with the left and right arrow keys, and then forward and backward with the up and down keys!```

### Project 2 - Four Corners

### Project 3 - Crazy Art!
```Create 2-3 functions that draw shapes with random colors and random sizes. Connect those functions to keys. When we press those keys really quickly, it turns into crazy art!```
