# Lesson 1 - Formatting and Input!

[Repl.it](https://repl.it/~)

Key Terms:
```markdown
variable - a piece of data/information for us to use in our code
integer - a number variable (ex: 8)
string - a word, sentence, or a collection of characters in a variable (ex: "i like turtles")
% - modulo - gives the remainder --> ex: 5 % 2 = 1
```

Important Code:
```markdown

`print("Hello world!") `        # print to the console
`myVar = input("Enter your input: ") `      # prompt user for input, save as variable
`print("This is my variable: ", myVar) `    # print words and variable
`int(myVar) `              # cast a variable to an integer (number)
`str(myVar) `              # cast a variable to a string (word, sentence, or a collection of characters)
`myVar[0] `                # access the first letter in the string
`myVar[-1] `               # access the last character in the string
`len(myVar `               # returns the size of the string (number of characters)
`myVar.capitalize() `      # capitalizes the first letter in the string

```

### Project 1 - Names!
  - Have the user enter their first and last names (hint: use two lines of code to do this, not just one)
  - Print to the console "Welcome " followed by their first and last names capitalized!
  
  
### Project 2 - Vertical 4-letter word
  - Have the user enter a 4-letter word
  - Print the letters to the console with one letter on each line
  
  
### Project 3 - Vertical strings of any size!
  - Prompt the user to enter any sentence or word.
  - Print the string with one character on each line
  - Hint: Use a for-loop!
