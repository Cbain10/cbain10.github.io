# Lesson 3 - Branches

Key Terms:
```markdown
variable - a piece of data/information for us to use in our code
integer - a number variable (ex: 8)
string - a word, sentence, or a collection of characters in a variable (ex: "i like turtles")
% - modulo - gives the remainder --> ex: 5 % 2 = 1
```

Important Code:
```markdown

`myVar = input("Enter your input: ") `      # prompt user for input, save as variable
`str(myVar) `              # cast a variable to a string (word, sentence, or a collection of characters)
`myVar[0] `                # access the first letter in the string
`len(myVar) `               # returns the size of the string (number of characters)

```

### Project 1 - Numbers 1-10
  - Prompt the user for a number between 1 and 10
  - Use if and else statements to determine whether the number is even or odd
  - Use if and else statements to determine whether the number is greater than 5
  - Print the results to the console
  
 ### Project 2 - Number Guesser
  - Prompt the user to enter a number that is divisible by 2
  - Then prompt the user to enter a number that is divisible by 4
  - Use conditionals to determine whether both numbers are correct, one is correct, or neither are correct
  - Print the results to the console
